### Description

Text paragraph.

**Type**: Block

Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each paragraph element.
