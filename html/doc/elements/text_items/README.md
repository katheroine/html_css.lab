### Tag

```html
<i></i>
```

### Description

Voice or mood, text of different quality than normal prose.

**Type**: Inline

**Categories**:
* Flow content
* Phrasing content
* Palpable content

**Contexts in which this element can be used**:
* Where phrasing content is expected

**Content model**: Phrasing content

The `i` element represents a span of text in an *alternate voice or mood*, or otherwise offset from the normal prose in a manner indicating a different quality of text for readability reasons. This would be a range of text with different semantic meaning than the surrounding text.

#### Use cases

* *Alternative voice or mood*
* *Taxonomic designations* (such as the genus and species "Homo sapiens")
* *Idiomatic terms from another language* (such as "et cetera"); these should include the lang attribute to identify the language
* *Technical terms*
* *Transliterations*
* *Thoughts* (such as "She wondered, What is this writer talking about, anyway?")
* *Ship or vessel names* in Western writing systems (such as "They searched the docks for the Empress of the Galaxy, the ship to which they were assigned.")

The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

#### History

Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <i> naming of this element.

Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <i> naming of this element.

In earlier versions of the HTML specification, the <i> element was merely a presentational element used to display text in italics, much like the <b> element was used to display text in bold letters. This is no longer true, as these tags now define semantics rather than typographic appearance. A browser will typically still display the contents of the <i> element in italic type, but is, by definition, no longer required to do so. To display text in italic type, authors should use the CSS font-style property.

### Attributes

Authors can use the `class` attribute on the `i` element to identify *why* the element is being used, so that if the style of a particular use (e.g. dream sequences as opposed to taxonomic terms) is to be changed at a later date, the author doesn't have to go through the entire document (or series of related documents) annotating each use.

Terms in languages different from the main text should be annotated with `lang` attributes (or, in XML, `lang` attributes in the XML namespace).

|Attributes support|   |
