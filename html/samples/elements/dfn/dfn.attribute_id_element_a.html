        <dfn id="sa_dfn">Software architecture</dfn> is the set of structures needed to reason about a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        The architecture of a software system is a metaphor, analogous to the architecture of a building. It functions as the blueprints for the system and the development project, which project management can later use to extrapolate the tasks necessary to be executed by the teams and people involved.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="#sa_dfn">Software architecture</a> is about making fundamental structural choices that are costly to change once implemented. Software architecture choices include specific structural options from possibilities in the design of the software.
