        In literary analysis, authors sometimes express an <i>alternative voice or mood</i> to create a distinct tone in their narration. For example, when describing humans, scientists often use the taxonomic designation <i>Homo sapiens</i>.

        When quoting foreign idiomatic terms like <i lang="la">et cetera</i>, it is important to include the language attribute to clarify its origin. Technical fields also have their jargon; for instance, in computing, the term <i>bitrate</i> refers to the number of bits processed per second.

        Sometimes foreign words are transliterated for clarity, such as the Russian name <i>Tolstoy</i>. In fictional writing, internal <i>thoughts</i> might be italicized, like: She wondered, <i>What is this writer talking about, anyway?</i>

        Furthermore, ship or vessel names are traditionally italicized in Western writing systems; for example, they searched the docks for the <i>Empress of the Galaxy</i>, the ship to which they were assigned.
