        In information technology, <abbr title="Command Query Responsibility Segregation">CQRS</abbr> is a system architecture that extends the idea behind commandâ€“query separation (CQS) to the level of services.[1][2] Such a system will have separate interfaces to send queries and to send commands. As in CQS, fulfilling a query request will only retrieve data and will not modify the state of the system (with some exceptions like logging access), while fulfilling a command request will modify the state of the system.
