        <strong><abbr>DDD</abbr> (Domain-Driven Design)</strong> is a major software design approach, focusing on modeling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.[2] DDD is against the idea of having a single unified model; instead it divides a large system into bounded contexts, each of which have their own model.
