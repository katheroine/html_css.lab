        It is important to <em>understand</em> the fundamentals before moving on. When discussing habits, one might say, “I <em>really</em> need to improve my time management.” In the sentence, “She <em>does</em> want to attend the meeting,” the emphasis on <em>does</em> changes the meaning.

        In foreign phrases, you might stress words like <em lang="fr">c’est la vie</em> to highlight their nuance. In poetry or prose, authors use emphasis to convey emotion or contrast, as when writing, “He was <em>not</em> the person she thought he was.”
